# Phase 4 — Vective Evaluation Doctrine Intent Freeze

**Original filename: 04f_repo-a-dir-vective-intent-freeze.md**

---

**Project:** CJK_KnowledgeHub  
**Phase:** 4 (Implementation Stabilization)  
**Status:** Locked  
**Upstream Dependencies:**  
- Phase 1 — Intent Freeze  
- Phase 2 — Architecture & Presentation Intent Freeze  
- Phase 3 — Execution Planning Intent Freeze  
- Phase 4 — Repository & Directory Intent Freeze  

---

## 1. Purpose of This Document

This document freezes the outcome of Phase 4 implementation stabilization.

Phase 4 resolves structural ambiguity, finalizes contextual substrate placement, and formalizes the evaluation doctrine required for artifact construction.

No artifact content is generated in this phase.

This phase establishes deterministic preconditions for Phase 5.

---

## 2. Scope of Phase 4 (Final)

Phase 4 governs:

1. Canonical placement of the fictional context package (Vective).
2. Centralization of the Vective Source Pack.
3. Formalization and freeze of Evaluation Doctrine v1.0.
4. Navigation integrity and MkDocs structural validation.
5. Elimination of legacy or placeholder references.

No additional domains were introduced.

No architectural reinterpretation occurred.

---

## 3. Vective — Final Governance Position

Vective is defined as:

- A fictional SaaS context package.
- Appendix-contained.
- Subordinate to artifacts.
- Non-architectural in identity.

Vective is not:

- A system layer.
- A framework showcase.
- A benchmark suite.
- A seventh domain.
- A narrative product identity.

Vective exists solely to provide stable contextual continuity across:

- Prompt Engineering case studies,
- Workflow demonstrations,
- Documentation artifacts.

---

## 4. Source Pack — Final Structural Position

The Vective Source Pack is:

- Canonical.
- Centralized.
- Appendix-contained.
- Non-duplicated.

It exists to:

- Provide reusable input surfaces.
- Enable consistent evaluation.
- Prevent artifact-specific duplication.

It does not:

- Function as a lab.
- Serve as independent content.
- Introduce infrastructural signaling.

---

## 5. Evaluation Doctrine v1.0 — Freeze

The following are frozen:

- Five Core Evaluation Axes.
- Seven Canonical Evaluation Fixtures.
- Standardized Fixture Template.
- Routing Implication Hooks.

Evaluation doctrine exists to:

- Provide systematic assessment logic.
- Enable reproducible reasoning.
- Support workflow integration.

It does not:

- Provide scoring metrics.
- Serve as public benchmarking.
- Replace artifact narrative.

All artifacts in Phase 5 must reference, not redefine, this doctrine.

---

## 6. Structural Integrity Confirmation

The following conditions have been verified:

- MkDocs navigation aligns with Phase 2 architecture.
- No duplicate domain entries exist.
- No legacy placeholder naming remains.
- YAML v0.2 remains authoritative.
- No unintended directory expansion occurred.

Phase 4 introduced no structural drift.

---

## 7. Explicit Non-Goals of Phase 4

Phase 4 did not:

- Produce public-facing artifacts.
- Create evaluation scorecards.
- Introduce automation layers.
- Reinterpret domain mapping.
- Optimize for incremental release.

Phase 4 was stabilization only.

---

## 8. Phase 4 Completion Criteria (Satisfied)

Phase 4 is complete when:

- Vective placement is canonical.
- Source Pack is centralized.
- Evaluation Doctrine is frozen.
- Repo structure is validated.
- No open structural ambiguities remain.

All criteria are satisfied.

---

## 9. Transition Control

With this document:

- Phase 4 is formally complete.
- Phase 5 (Prompt Engineering Artifact Construction) may begin.
- No further structural modification is permitted without revising this freeze.

Future work must conform to the structural and evaluative constraints defined herein.
