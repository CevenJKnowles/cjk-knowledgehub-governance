## 2026-02-16 — Planning Cluster Consolidation

The following documents were deprecated and consolidated into:

### Deprecated Files

- {DEP}-00d_planning-phases.md
- {DEP}-00b_planning-phases--discussion-checklist.md
- {DEP}-00e_project-workflow.md

Reason:
Redundant phase sequencing and workflow logic consolidated into a single authoritative planning map.

Impact:
No loss of authority.
Planning structure simplified.

Replaced By:
- GOV-MAP-01-project-brief.md
- PLN-MAP-02-strategy-notes.md
- DAT-REF-01-background-data.md

Reason:
Hybrid document contained governance, planning, and data payload. 
Separated into deterministic layer-aligned documents.

Replaced By:
- CTL-DOC-01-phase4-implementation-architecture.md
- PLN-PLAN-02-phase4-repo-structure-next-step.md

Deprecated:
- {DEP}-04g_phase-4-snapshot.md
- {DEP}-04h_post-phase-4-imp-eva-doctrine-freeze.md
