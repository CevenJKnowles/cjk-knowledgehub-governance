# Phase 4 | Repository & Directory Intent Freeze (Canonical)

**Project:** CJK_Knowledgehub  
**Applies To:** Phase 4 and all downstream phases  
**Status:** Locked  
**Purpose:** Prevent structural drift during implementation

---

## 1. Purpose of This Document

This document freezes the **intent and role** of the repository and directory structure before any files are created.

It exists to ensure that:
- structure serves interpretation,
- directories do not imply unintended meaning,
- and infrastructure does not become content.

This is a **governance artifact**, not a filesystem tutorial.

---

## 2. Repository Role (Frozen)

The repository exists to:

- host canonical source markdown,
- support deterministic static site generation,
- enable transparent review and version control.
- Canonical placement of the fictional context package (Vective).
- Centralization of the Vective Source Pack.
- Formalization and freeze of Evaluation Doctrine v1.0.
- Navigation integrity and MkDocs structural validation.
- Elimination of legacy or placeholder references.

The repository does **not** exist to:

- document learning,
- host experiments,
- showcase tooling,
- or function as a general knowledge base.

---

## 3. Domain-to-Directory Mapping (Invariant)

Each canonical domain maps to **exactly one top-level directory**.

- Profile  
- Prompt Engineering  
- Workflows  
- Documentation  
- Career Trajectory  
- Appendix  

No additional top-level content directories are permitted.

---

## 4. Media Directory — Intent & Constraints

### 4.1 Media Directory Status

- A media directory **is permitted**
- It is classified as **supporting infrastructure**
- It is **not** a content domain

---

### 4.2 Media Directory Rules

Media assets:

- may be present in the repository,
- may be served by GitHub Pages,
- may be referenced by canonical pages.

Media assets must **not**:

- appear in navigation,
- have landing pages or indexes,
- exist as standalone artifacts,
- introduce meaning independently of text.

---

### 4.3 Justification Rule

Every media asset must satisfy all of the following:

- be referenced by at least one canonical page,
- directly support an explicit design decision or explanation,
- be removable without breaking narrative coherence.

Unreferenced or decorative assets are removed.

---

## 5. Structural Signaling Rules

Directory names must:

- reflect architectural intent,
- not suggest additional domains,
- not imply exploratory or experimental content.

No directory may exist whose purpose cannot be stated in one sentence.

---

## 6. Disallowed Structural Patterns

The following are explicitly disallowed:

- media galleries
- asset showcases
- exploratory folders
- draft or scratch directories
- tooling-named directories (e.g. “figma”, “exports”, “notes”)

If content does not belong to a canonical domain, it does not belong in the repo.

---

## 7. Change Control

Any change to:

- directory structure,
- domain mapping,
- or infrastructure intent

requires:
- explicit discussion,
- documented rationale,
- and approval by Ceven.

Silent structural evolution is prohibited.

---
## 8. Vective — Final Governance Position

Vective is defined as:

- A fictional SaaS context package.
- Appendix-contained.
- Subordinate to artifacts.
- Non-architectural in identity.

Vective is not:

- A system layer.
- A framework showcase.
- A benchmark suite.
- A seventh domain.
- A narrative product identity.

Vective exists solely to provide stable contextual continuity across:

- Prompt Engineering case studies,
- Workflow demonstrations,
- Documentation artifacts.

---

## 9. Source Pack — Final Structural Position

The Vective Source Pack is:

- Canonical.
- Centralized.
- Appendix-contained.
- Non-duplicated.

It exists to:

- Provide reusable input surfaces.
- Enable consistent evaluation.
- Prevent artifact-specific duplication.

It does not:

- Function as a lab.
- Serve as independent content.
- Introduce infrastructural signaling.

---

## 10. Evaluation Doctrine v1.0 — Freeze

The following are frozen:

- Five Core Evaluation Axes.
- Seven Canonical Evaluation Fixtures.
- Standardized Fixture Template.
- Routing Implication Hooks.

Evaluation doctrine exists to:

- Provide systematic assessment logic.
- Enable reproducible reasoning.
- Support workflow integration.

It does not:

- Provide scoring metrics.
- Serve as public benchmarking.
- Replace artifact narrative.

All artifacts in Phase 5 must reference, not redefine, this doctrine.

---

## 11. Structural Integrity Confirmation

The following conditions have been verified:

- MkDocs navigation aligns with Phase 2 architecture.
- No duplicate domain entries exist.
- No legacy placeholder naming remains.
- YAML v0.2 remains authoritative.
- No unintended directory expansion occurred.

Phase 4 introduced no structural drift.

---
## 12. Explicit Non-Goals of Phase 4

Phase 4 did not:

- Produce public-facing artifacts.
- Create evaluation scorecards.
- Introduce automation layers.
- Reinterpret domain mapping.
- Optimize for incremental release.

Phase 4 was stabilization only.

---

## 13. Phase 4 Completion Criteria (Satisfied)

Phase 4 is complete when:

- Vective placement is canonical.
- Source Pack is centralized.
- Evaluation Doctrine is frozen.
- Repo structure is validated.
- No open structural ambiguities remain.

All criteria are satisfied.

---

## 14. Transition Control

With this document:

- Phase 4 is formally complete.
- Phase 5 (Prompt Engineering Artifact Construction) may begin.
- No further structural modification is permitted without revising this freeze.

Future work must conform to the structural and evaluative constraints defined herein.
