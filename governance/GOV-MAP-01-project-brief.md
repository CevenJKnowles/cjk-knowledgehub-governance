# CJK KnowledgeHub 2026 Brief

2026-02-08 by Ceven J. Knowles

## Purpose & Overview

This document serves as a source of truth concerning the complete recalibration of my current ***CJK KnowledgeHub*** with the intention of repositioning me for the most optimal exposure and consideration to ATS, Job Recruiters, and Hiring Managers in my job search.

### History

**ca. October / Novermber 2025**
The CJK KnowledgeHub was originally conceived and implemented in its most basic form to serve as a knowledge base and tech portfolio to be reviewed by potential employers as part of my career change from Interdisciplinary Designer (creative field: Creative Director | Art Director | Media Designer) to AI Prompt Engineer | AI Workflows | AI Engineer and similar roles. The git repo was largely abandoned due to workloads (job applications, certification studies & skills updates, CV rewrites, job market research, and a lack of substantial portfolio-worthy material). 

The project began as a Zettlr workspace and GitHub repo that was turned into a an wiki-styled mkdocs deployment. The contents were largely speculative based on conversations with Io-II but my focus and studies have deviated since then, rendering the flagship projects "Io Architecture" and "Prompt Pattern Library" too complex to include at their current project status states.

**Current**
The project sits untouched for quite some time.

## The New KnowledgeHub

The new knowledgehub should present Ceven Jupiter Knowles, his most current CV information, biography, projects, and special portfolio pieces that best reflects his optimal candidacy based on evaluations, intentions, and future forecasts.

### Strategy for Io
Over the course of this session and future ones, we will update all parts of the git repo and gitpage. We do not finish all this in one session, or even today - we are in the Planning and PM preliminary phase.

**GitHub & Public-facing GitPage Redesign Planning**
- Retrieve, extract, and consolidate all information into one context window. Save it for future recall and analysis.
- Analyse the entire git repo against contemporary professional standards and optimal positioning (without inflation of skills, position, work history, or character).
- Discuss and Develop a git architecture plan that covers all aspects and intentions optimally. This includes content, file structure, meta-data, documentation processes, information hierarchy and relevant foundational planning.
- Discuss and commit to a definitive workflow that includes phases, milestones, collaborative Io-Ceven alignment recalibrations, and task-by-task to-do checklists that can be paused and picked up with no drift or misalignment.
- Develop an organisational workflow that keeps track of all changes and movements concerning this git repo so that we can keep a stable eye over progress and tasks.
- Setup optimal project and administrative workspace environment for Ceven that includes tools, local and online git automatons, and knowledgehub continuity.
- Fill Knowledgehub with all relevant available information.
- Add Prompt Engineering promp patterns for potential employers to see prompting competencies.
- Implement aesthetic changes (typography, colours, visual layout, etc).
- Implement all changes and deploy new gitpage
- Test and perform quality controls across various means
