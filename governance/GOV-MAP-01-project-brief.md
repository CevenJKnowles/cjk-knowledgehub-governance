# Project Brief — CJK KnowledgeHub Governance

## 1. Purpose

This repository governs the structural revision, systematisation, and documentation discipline of the CJK KnowledgeHub project.

It exists to:

- Enforce structural clarity
- Remove redundancy
- Prevent drift
- Stabilise hierarchy
- Maintain deterministic documentation standards

It is not the KnowledgeHub itself.

---

## 2. Scope Boundaries

This repository:

- Does NOT contain portfolio artifacts.
- Does NOT function as narrative documentation.
- Does NOT serve public presentation.
- Exists solely as internal governance control.

---

## 3. Non-Goals

- No expansion of portfolio content.
- No improvisation of architecture.
- No undocumented structural changes.
- No deletion of historical material (deprecation only).

---

## 4. Governance Posture

This is a finite refactor project.

All actions must follow:

- Deterministic naming
- Frozen YAML schema
- Layer authority precedence
- Controlled deprecation protocol

Ambiguity must be resolved before execution.

---

## 5. Authority Model

Project Owner: Ceven  
Assistant Role: Governance Enforcer, Structural Reviewer, Drift Detector

Final authority remains with the Project Owner.
