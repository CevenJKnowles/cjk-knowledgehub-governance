# Phase 1 | Intent Freeze (Canonical)

**Status:** Locked  
**Phase:** 1 (Content Model & Intent Definition)  
**Purpose:** Freeze intent, scope, and content rules before architecture or implementation

---

## 1. Purpose of the KnowledgeHub

CJK KnowledgeHub is a **public-facing professional system** designed to present Ceven as:

- a skilled and capable practitioner,
- a credible potential coworker,
- a system-oriented thinker able to transition across domains,
- and a professional who exercises judgment, restraint, and clarity.

It is **not**:
- a learning archive,
- a coursework repository,
- a “learning in public” log,
- or a general knowledge base.

The primary audience is **recruiters, hiring managers, and technical reviewers**.  
All other audiences are secondary.

---

## 2. Core Design Principle

> **Everything in the KnowledgeHub must function as recruiter-legible evidence.**

Content exists only if it improves:
- interpretability,
- professional trust,
- role alignment,
- or evidence of applied judgment.

Volume, breadth, or theoretical completeness are not goals.

---

## 3. Canonical Content Domains (Final)

The KnowledgeHub is built around **six intentional domains**:

1. **Profile**  
   Identity, positioning, and interpretive context.

2. **Prompt Engineering**  
   Exactly **three** applied case studies demonstrating prompt design, evaluation, and judgment.

3. **Workflows**  
   How complex work is structured, executed, and recovered when it fails.

4. **Documentation**  
   Documentation as a professional capability, including structure, scope decisions, and governance.

5. **Professional Context & Credibility**  
   Career coherence, transferability of competencies, and collaboration posture.

6. **Appendix**  
   Certifications, skills, tools, and metadata presented as a professional reference system.

No other domains are permitted without explicit revision of this intent freeze.

---

## 4. Success Criteria (Global)

Across all domains, content must:

- be bounded in scope,
- demonstrate applied judgment,
- show awareness of limits or tradeoffs,
- avoid performative complexity,
- respect the reader’s time,
- and remain defensible in conversation.

If content cannot meet these criteria, it does not belong in the KnowledgeHub.

---

## 5. Explicit Exclusions (Hard Rules)

The following content types are globally excluded:

- learning journeys or coursework
- study notes or theory dumps
- foundational methods framed as education
- prompt collections without context or evaluation
- “tips & tricks” content
- tool shopping lists or trend chasing
- personal essays or emotional narratives
- any framing that positions the author as “still learning”

These exclusions apply across all domains unless an explicit exception is approved.

---

## 6. Exception Protocol (Approved)

Exceptions are allowed **case by case**, using the following rule:

Uncertain content must pass **at least 2 of 3**:

1. **Evidence Value**  
   Demonstrates applied judgment, not just knowledge.

2. **Role Signal**  
   Strengthens alignment with target roles now.

3. **Interpretability**  
   A recruiter can understand why it exists in under 30 seconds.

All exceptions must be:
- explicitly discussed,
- briefly documented,
- and revisitable later.

Silent exceptions are not permitted.

---

## 7. Authority & Narrative Control

CJK KnowledgeHub is the **narrative authority**.

Other projects (e.g. Prompt Pattern Library, Io Architecture) may be:
- referenced,
- summarized,
- or linked,

**only** insofar as they strengthen the KnowledgeHub’s professional signal.

The KnowledgeHub defines how other work is interpreted, not the reverse.

---

## 8. Phase 1 Closure

With this document:

- Intent is frozen.
- Scope is fixed.
- Content rules are locked.
- Phase 1 is formally complete.

Future phases (Architecture, Workflow, Implementation) must conform to this intent unless this document is explicitly revised.
