# Canonical Project Workflow (End-to-End)

---
---
# ⚠ Deprecated
Superseded by: PLN-MAP-01-project-workflow.md
Date: 2026-02-16

---
---

**Purpose:**  
Define the complete, professional workflow for designing, building, maintaining, and evolving the CJK KnowledgeHub without drift, scope creep, or loss of intent.

This document is the **authoritative execution map**.  
All work must align with it unless explicitly revised.

---

## Phase 0 — Orientation & Alignment (Pre-Work)

**Purpose:**  
Ensure shared understanding before any design or execution begins.

### Steps
- Establish project goals and audience
- Clarify role alignment and professional positioning
- Identify and discard incorrect mental models early
- Confirm that the KnowledgeHub is a **portfolio system**, not a learning archive

**Exit Criteria**
- Misalignments identified and corrected
- Agreement to proceed deliberately, not reactively

---

## Phase 1 — Content Model & Intent Definition (Intent Freeze)

**Purpose:**  
Define *what the KnowledgeHub is* and *what it is not* before structure or content exists.

### Steps
1. Define the purpose of the KnowledgeHub
2. Lock the primary audience (recruiters, hiring managers, technical reviewers)
3. Define and approve canonical content domains
4. Define success criteria per domain
5. Define hard exclusions and anti-goals
6. Define exception-handling rules
7. Freeze intent in a formal governance artifact

**Key Output**
- Phase 1 Intent Freeze (canonical)

**Exit Criteria**
- Intent is frozen
- Scope is explicit
- No further debate about “what belongs”

---

## Phase 2 — Architecture & Presentation Planning (Architecture Freeze)

**Purpose:**  
Translate frozen intent into a coherent, navigable, and durable system design.

### Phase 2.1 — Top-Level Information Architecture
- Select IA model
- Define primary entry point
- Define navigation hierarchy
- Lock domain naming and prominence

---

### Phase 2.2 — Domain-Internal Architecture
- Define what kinds of pages exist per domain
- Define maximum depth and boundaries
- Prevent internal sprawl

---

### Phase 2.3 — Content Presentation System
- Define canonical page types
- Define global section vocabulary
- Define domain-specific emphasis rules
- Establish consistency without rigidity

---

### Phase 2.4 — Metadata & Continuity Schema
- Decide on YAML front-matter usage
- Define global required metadata
- Define minimal domain-specific metadata
- Define tag taxonomy rules
- Define cross-linking principles

---

### Phase 2.5 — Navigation & Reading Paths
- Define recruiter, hiring manager, and technical reviewer paths
- Use emphasis and signposting, not user detection
- Design intentional friction

---

### Phase 2.6 — Lightweight Governance
- Define content admission rules
- Define revision triggers
- Define pause/resume protocol
- Lock anti-drift safeguards

**Key Output**
- Phase 2 Architecture & Presentation Intent Freeze (canonical)

**Exit Criteria**
- Architecture is locked
- Presentation logic is fixed
- Metadata schema is frozen
- Navigation intent is clear

---

## Phase 3 — Workflow & Execution Planning

**Purpose:**  
Convert architecture into a **practical, low-friction build plan**.

### Steps
1. Define build order by impact (what ships first)
2. Identify dependencies between domains
3. Decide when repo access is required
4. Define task granularity (what counts as “done”)
5. Establish review checkpoints
6. Define rollback and adjustment rules

**Outputs**
- Execution roadmap
- Task sequencing plan
- Review checkpoints

**Exit Criteria**
- Clear, ordered execution plan
- No ambiguity about next actions

---

## Phase 4 — Implementation & Content Build

**Purpose:**  
Build the KnowledgeHub according to frozen intent and architecture.

### Steps
- Set up repo structure
- Implement navigation and layout
- Create or curate content per domain
- Apply canonical page types
- Apply metadata schema
- Enforce presentation consistency

**Rules**
- No new domains
- No scope expansion
- Exceptions must follow Phase 1 rules

**Exit Criteria**
- All required content exists
- Structure matches architecture
- No provisional or ambiguous content

---

## Phase 5 — Review, QA & Refinement

**Purpose:**  
Ensure professional quality, coherence, and trustworthiness.

### Steps
- Cross-domain consistency review
- Reading-path validation
- Metadata sanity check
- Signal clarity review (recruiter perspective)
- Technical coherence review
- Remove or refine weak content

**Exit Criteria**
- System reads clearly and confidently
- No redundancy or noise
- No misleading signals

---

## Phase 6 — Deployment & Public Release

**Purpose:**  
Make the KnowledgeHub publicly available with confidence.

### Steps
- Deploy GitHub Pages
- Verify navigation and links
- Confirm public readability
- Validate that Appendix and deep material are not overexposed

**Exit Criteria**
- Stable public deployment
- No accidental exposure or broken flows

---

## Phase 7 — Maintenance & Evolution

**Purpose:**  
Keep the KnowledgeHub relevant without drift.

### Steps
- Periodic review against target roles
- Replace weaker evidence with stronger evidence
- Archive outdated material deliberately
- Apply governance rules consistently

**Non-Goals**
- Chasing trends
- Expanding breadth unnecessarily
- Turning the KnowledgeHub into a log or diary

**Exit Criteria**
- KnowledgeHub remains lean, coherent, and senior

---

## Global Rules (Apply to All Phases)

- Intent beats convenience
- Restraint beats volume
- Evidence beats assertion
- Structure beats cleverness
- Nothing is added “just in case”

**End of Canonical Workflow**
