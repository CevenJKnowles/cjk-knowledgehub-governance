## 1. Session Objective (Original Intent)

Resume **Phase 4 — Implementation & Content Build** under governance contract.

Constraints:
- All prior intent freezes remain authoritative.
- Repo structure must align to Phase 2 freeze.
- Mechanical execution under review gates.
- No content generation until scaffolding is correct.

---

## 2. What Was Done Today

### A. Infrastructure Stabilization
- Verified correct repo path:
  `/home/cjk/Dev/GitHub/CJK_KnowledgeHub`
- Clean local backup of old KnowledgeHub confirmed.
- Git baseline committed.
- YAML Metadata Schema v0.2 frozen.
- MkDocs environment rebuilt using dedicated venv:
  `/home/cjk/Dev/Environments/knowledgehub-mkdocs`
- `khub()` dev command created (activate + serve + auto-deactivate).

Infrastructure is now stable.

---

### B. Naming Decision
- A fictional enterprise system was required as demonstration substrate.
- Initial placeholder name: FlowCore (temporary).
- Final locked name: **Vective**.
- All scaffold references renamed to Vective.
- Rename committed and pushed.

Important:
Vective is a fictional demonstration system,
NOT the KnowledgeHub identity.

---

### C. Strategic Fork (Resolved)

Decision Locked:
Vective will serve as an integrated substrate for:

1. Prompt Evaluation Framework
2. Workflow Orchestration
3. Safety & Governance Design

This is one unified demonstration environment,
not three unrelated projects.

---

### D. Misalignment Moment

Structural drift occurred when:
- Vective was temporarily elevated to top-level identity.
- Narrative framing shifted from portfolio structure to product architecture.
- Placement logic became unclear (appendix vs top-level vs domain-contained).

Drift has been acknowledged.
No structural changes were finalized beyond renaming.

---

## 3. Current Ground Truth

### Repository State
- Clean scaffold exists.
- YAML v0.2 active.
- MkDocs operational.
- No content created yet.
- No Source Pack scaffold finalized.
- No final placement for Vective container locked.

### Conceptual State
We have locked:
- Integrated Vective substrate (Lock A)
We have NOT locked:
- Exact folder placement for Vective.
- Exact folder hierarchy for its internal structure.
- Navigation design strategy.

We paused before executing further structure changes.

---

## 4. Open Decisions (Unresolved)

1. Where does Vective live structurally?
   - Under prompt-engineering?
   - Hybrid system + project layout?
   - Alternative?

2. What is the cleanest structure that:
   - Signals systems thinking
   - Is recruiter-friendly
   - Does not overcomplicate navigation
   - Aligns to Phase 2 freeze

3. How do we prevent structural drift while preserving strength?

---

## 5. Risk Assessment

The risk is not technical.

The risk is:
- Over-architecting
- Narrative drift
- Structure inflation
- Losing alignment with frozen scope

We must return to:
Mechanical, minimal, governance-aligned progression.

---

## 6. What Has NOT Been Done

- No Source Pack files created.
- No Vective directories scaffolded.
- No evaluation layer implemented.
- No orchestration logic implemented.
- No governance documentation written.

We are still at **Gate 1 — Structural Definition**.
