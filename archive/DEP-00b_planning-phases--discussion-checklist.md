## Phase 1 — Repo Audit & Positioning Analysis  
### Discussion Topics Checklist

### A. Inventory & Scope
- Which repositories currently exist and are in scope?
- Are there any private/local-only repos that should be considered?
- What sub-projects are active vs dormant vs archived?
- Are there duplicated concepts across repos (overlap risk)?

---

### B. Asset Classification
- Which assets are:
  - Public-ready
  - Conditionally public
  - Internal-only
  - Archive-only
- What criteria define each category?
- Which assets must *not* be publicly visible yet?

---

### C. Evidence vs Claim Integrity
- For each major asset:
  - What claims does it implicitly make?
  - What concrete evidence supports those claims?
- Where is the risk of perceived skill inflation?
- Where is strong evidence currently under-signaled?

---

### D. Role Alignment Check
- How does each asset map to target roles?
  - Prompt Engineer / Prompt Specialist
  - AI Workflow Specialist
  - Technical Documentation / GenAI Documentation Engineer
- Are any assets misaligned or confusing for these roles?
- Are there assets that support secondary roles unintentionally?

---

### E. Market & Professional Standards
- Does each asset reflect current (2025–2026) expectations?
- Does it read as:
  - Academic
  - Hobbyist
  - Experimental
  - Professional / production-aware
- What might a German recruiter misinterpret?

---

### F. Risk & Liability Review
- Are there unfinished or speculative elements that look like overreach?
- Are there outdated assumptions or terminology?
- Are there places where tone implies more certainty than warranted?

---

## Phase 2 — Architecture Planning (Conceptual)  
### Discussion Topics Checklist

### A. Audience Definition
- Who are the primary audiences?
  - Recruiters
  - Hiring managers
  - Technical reviewers
- What does each audience *need* vs *tolerate*?
- What should never be forced on non-technical readers?

---

### B. Layer Boundaries
- What belongs in:
  - Public GitPage
  - Linked GitHub portfolio
  - Internal R&D space
- What must stay invisible to recruiters?
- How explicit should boundaries be?

---

### C. Narrative vs Evidence Separation
- What content is explanatory vs demonstrative?
- Where should interpretation live vs raw artifacts?
- How do we prevent narrative dilution?

---

### D. Information Hierarchy
- What is the first thing a visitor should understand?
- What is optional depth?
- What is “only if you care deeply”?

---

### E. Portfolio Scope Control
- How many projects is “enough”?
- What signals completion vs exploration?
- When does adding more content reduce clarity?

---

### F. Metadata & Discoverability (Conceptual)
- What metadata matters for:
  - ATS
  - GitHub search
  - Human scanning
- What metadata is unnecessary noise?

---

## Phase 3 — Workflow & Governance Design  
### Discussion Topics Checklist

### A. Phase Ordering Logic
- In what order should work always occur?
- What must never happen out of order?
- Where are hard stop points?

---

### B. Milestones & Exit Criteria
- How do we define “done” for a phase?
- What evidence is required to move on?
- Who confirms phase closure?

---

### C. Task Granularity
- How small should tasks be?
- What counts as one session of work?
- How do we prevent scope creep mid-task?

---

### D. Alignment & Recalibration
- When do we explicitly re-align (Io ↔ Ceven)?
- What triggers a recalibration?
- How do we document alignment decisions?

---

### E. Change Tracking & Memory
- What changes need to be logged?
- What decisions need rationale?
- How do we avoid undocumented drift?

---

### F. Sustainability & Cognitive Load
- How do we keep the project light over time?
- How do we prevent maintenance fatigue?
- How do we re-enter after a long pause?

---

## End of Discussion Checklist

Rule of engagement:
- Discuss all topics in a phase before moving to the next
- No execution during discussion phases
- Decisions are written, not assumed
