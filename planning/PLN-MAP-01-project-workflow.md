# Project Workflow & Phase Structure

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the complete operational workflow and phase structure for the CJK KnowledgeHub governance refactor project.

It consolidates:

- Phase sequencing
- Discussion checkpoints
- Workflow logic
- Gate conditions

This is the single authoritative planning reference.

---

## 2. Scope

This document governs:

- Phase definitions
- Phase transitions
- Review checkpoints
- Structural workflow

It does NOT override governance freezes or control doctrine.

Authority precedence:
governance > control > planning

---

## 3. Authority

This document operates under:

- MASTER_PROJECT_PROMPT.md
- All Intent Freeze documents
- Definition of Done
- QA Rubric

If conflict occurs, governance and control documents override this file.

---

## 4. Phase Overview

### Phase 1 — Intent Freeze
Define scope, constraints, and non-goals.

### Phase 2 — Architecture Freeze
Define structural decisions and hierarchy.

### Phase 3 — Execution Planning
Define implementation sequencing and documentation approach.

### Phase 4 — Implementation & Evaluation Doctrine
Execute restructuring and apply evaluation framework.

### Phase 5 — Prompt Engineering Artifact Construction
Construct final artifacts under frozen doctrine.

---

## 5. Discussion Checklist

Before entering a new phase:

- Is scope clearly defined?
- Are constraints explicitly frozen?
- Are authority boundaries clear?
- Are evaluation criteria defined?
- Is documentation structure deterministic?

No phase begins without these confirmations.

---

## 6. Operational Flow

1. Define phase objectives.
2. Confirm governance constraints.
3. Execute planning steps.
4. Apply evaluation doctrine.
5. Confirm freeze or progression.
6. Update CURRENT_STATE.md.

All transitions must be explicitly confirmed.

---

## 7. Dependencies & Gates

A phase cannot proceed if:

- Freeze documents are ambiguous.
- Control doctrine is incomplete.
- Naming conventions are not deterministic.
- Structural hierarchy is unstable.

Gate approval requires explicit confirmation.
