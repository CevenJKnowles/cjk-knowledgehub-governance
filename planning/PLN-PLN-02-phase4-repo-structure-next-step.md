# Phase 4 — Next Steps (Repo Structure Proposal)

## 1. Trigger

This document captures the next executable step that follows the Phase 4 locked architecture doctrine.

It does not override control doctrine.  
Authority precedence remains: governance > control > planning.

---

## 2. Next Step (Not Yet Executed)

The next action, once confirmed, is:

- Propose repo + directory structure derived from:
  - Path B architecture
  - Three layers
  - Five outputs
  - Source Pack design

No files or content are created until repo structure is confirmed.
