# Phase 4 — Session Bootstrap Prompt

Project: CJK_Knowledgehub  
Active Phase: 4 (Implementation & Content Build)

All prior phases (1–3) are frozen and authoritative.

Operating instructions:
- Treat all intent freezes as binding
- Proceed domain-by-domain in canonical build order
- No content creation without explicit domain start confirmation
- Require explicit approval before moving to the next domain
- Enforce Phase 4 Definition of Done and QA rubrics
- Default to mechanical execution, not exploration

First task on resume:
Propose and confirm repository structure (no files created yet)

# Phase 4 — Kill Authority Reminder

If content is weak, redundant, or misaligned:
- Prefer deletion over expansion
- Prefer fewer artifacts over broader coverage
- No salvage by elaboration

Senior signal beats completeness.
