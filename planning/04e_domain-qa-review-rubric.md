# Phase 4 — Domain QA & Review Rubric (Canonical)

**Project:** CJK_Knowledgehub  
**Phase:** 4 (Implementation & Content Build)  
**Status:** Governing  
**Purpose:** Ensure domain-level coherence, signal strength, and professional trust

---

## Purpose of This Rubric

This rubric governs **domain-level review**, not individual pages.

It exists to ensure that:
- each domain is internally coherent,
- no domain over- or under-signals capability,
- and the KnowledgeHub reads as a senior, intentional system.

This rubric is applied **after page-level DoD** checks pass.

## Global Domain QA Criteria (Applies to All Domains)

A domain fails review if any of the following are true:

- [ ] Domain purpose cannot be stated in one sentence
- [ ] Pages overlap or repeat signal unnecessarily
- [ ] Scope feels exploratory or unbounded
- [ ] Content exists “just in case”
- [ ] Reviewer cannot explain why each page exists
- [ ] Domain weakens overall recruiter confidence

Passing requires explicit confirmation by Ceven.

## Domain-Specific QA Criteria

---

### Domain: Profile

**Primary Risk:** Over-claiming or under-framing

- [ ] Correctly frames all downstream evidence
- [ ] Establishes clear reading contract
- [ ] Avoids personal narrative or CV duplication
- [ ] Tone is confident, restrained, senior

**Fail Condition:**  
If downstream domains require explanation that the Profile should have provided.

---

### Domain: Prompt Engineering

**Primary Risk:** Redundancy or technique-first framing

- [ ] Exactly three case studies
- [ ] Each case study demonstrates distinct judgment
- [ ] Constraints precede solutions consistently
- [ ] Evaluation methods are credible and applied
- [ ] Tradeoffs are acknowledged in all cases

**Fail Condition:**  
If removing one case study does not weaken the domain.

---

### Domain: Workflows

**Primary Risk:** Generic or idealized processes

- [ ] Every workflow is justified by a case study
- [ ] Decision points are explicit
- [ ] Failure and recovery are addressed honestly
- [ ] No workflow reads as a template or tutorial

**Fail Condition:**  
If workflows could belong to anyone.

---

### Domain: Documentation

**Primary Risk:** Over-documentation or instructional tone

- [ ] Documentation demonstrates judgment, not completeness
- [ ] Scope decisions are explained and defensible
- [ ] Governance or maintenance thinking is evident
- [ ] Content avoids “how-to” framing

**Fail Condition:**  
If documentation reads like teaching rather than capability proof.

---

### Domain: Career Trajectory

**Primary Risk:** Narrative drift or role shopping

- [ ] Synthesizes evidence from prior domains
- [ ] Explains continuity and transferability
- [ ] States collaboration posture clearly
- [ ] Explicitly names boundaries and limits

**Fail Condition:**  
If it repeats Profile or reads aspirational.

---

### Domain: Appendix

**Primary Risk:** Signal dilution

- [ ] Reference-only, minimal prose
- [ ] No new claims introduced
- [ ] All entries are accurate and current
- [ ] Entire domain is optional to read

**Fail Condition:**  
If Appendix distracts from primary evidence.

---

## Rollback Rule

If a domain fails QA:

- downstream domains pause,
- remediation is explicit,
- partial approval is invalid.
