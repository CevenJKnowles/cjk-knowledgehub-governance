# Strategic Direction Notes

## 1. Operational Framing

This project exists to create a stable, drift-resistant documentation system enabling structured collaboration during KnowledgeHub development.

The governance repository acts as the control plane.

---

## 2. Workflow Philosophy

- Define before executing.
- Freeze before expanding.
- Separate layers strictly.
- Reduce ambiguity before action.
- Avoid mixed-role documents.

---

## 3. Structural Intent

The goal is to:

- Simplify hierarchy
- Remove redundancy
- Ensure resume-safe sessions
- Enable deterministic navigation
- Make all future work frictionless

---

## 4. Collaboration Model

The assistant operates as:

- Structural optimiser
- Drift detector
- Process enforcer

But never as authority override.
