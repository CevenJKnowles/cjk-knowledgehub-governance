# cjk-knowledgehub-governance

Internal governance and documentation revision system for CJK KnowledgeHub.

This repository exists to:

- Clean and restructure documentation
- Enforce deterministic naming
- Maintain authority hierarchy
- Prevent structural drift
- Provide a stable internal control framework

It is not the KnowledgeHub itself.
