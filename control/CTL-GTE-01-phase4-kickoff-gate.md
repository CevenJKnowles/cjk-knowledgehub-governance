# Phase 4 — Kickoff Checklist (Canonical)

**Project:** CJK_Knowledgehub  
**Phase:** 4 (Implementation & Content Build)  
**Status:** Blocked until checklist is satisfied  
**Upstream Phases:**  
- Phase 1 — Intent Freeze (Canonical)  
- Phase 2 — Architecture & Presentation Intent Freeze (Canonical)  
- Phase 3 — Execution Planning Intent Freeze (Canonical)

---

## Purpose of This Checklist

This checklist exists to ensure that Phase 4 begins **only when the system is execution-ready**, not merely intention-ready.

Its function is to:
- prevent premature building,
- eliminate interpretive decisions during implementation,
- and ensure Phase 4 proceeds mechanically.

Phase 4 must feel *procedural*, not exploratory.

---

## Phase 4 Entry Preconditions

Phase 4 may begin **only if all items below are explicitly confirmed**.

---

## 1. Governance Confirmation

- [ ] Phase 1 Intent Freeze has been re-read in full
- [ ] Phase 2 Architecture & Presentation Intent Freeze has been re-read in full
- [ ] Phase 3 Execution Planning Intent Freeze has been re-read in full
- [ ] No open questions exist regarding scope, domains, or page types
- [ ] No intent revisions are pending

---

## 2. Domain Readiness Confirmation

- [ ] Canonical build order is accepted and unchanged
- [ ] All six domains are confirmed as final:
  - Profile
  - Prompt Engineering
  - Workflows
  - Documentation
  - Career Trajectory
  - Appendix
- [ ] No additional domains or sub-domains are proposed

---

## 3. Review & Authority Model Confirmation

- [ ] Domain-by-domain review by Ceven is active
- [ ] No domain may proceed without explicit approval
- [ ] Rollback is permitted at any domain boundary
- [ ] Silent continuation is disallowed

---

## 4. Content Handling Rules

- [ ] Hybrid content model is confirmed (curation + net-new)
- [ ] Weak fragments will be removed, not expanded
- [ ] No placeholder content is permitted
- [ ] No speculative or aspirational content is permitted

---

## 5. Implementation Discipline

- [ ] YAML front-matter is mandatory on all pages
- [ ] Canonical page types are enforced
- [ ] Phase 2 section vocabulary rules are enforced
- [ ] No page is allowed to exist “just in case”

---

## 6. Publication Constraint

- [ ] No public deployment before full Phase 4 completion
- [ ] No partial previews or incremental releases
- [ ] GitHub Pages deployment occurs only after Phase 4 exit

---

## Phase 4 Start Authorization

Phase 4 may begin **only when Ceven explicitly confirms**:

> “Begin Phase 4 — Implementation & Content Build”

Absent that confirmation:
- no repo setup,
- no file creation,
- no content drafting,
- no tooling decisions.
