# Phase 5 — Pre-Deployment & Public Release Checklist (Canonical)

**Project:** CJK_Knowledgehub  
**Phase:** 5 (Review, QA & Refinement → Deployment)  
**Status:** Governing  
**Purpose:** Ensure professional readiness before public exposure

---

## Purpose of This Checklist

This checklist ensures that public release:

- does not introduce unintended signals,
- does not expose provisional material,
- and reflects a senior, coherent system.

Deployment is a **deliberate act**, not a technical step.

---

## 1. Structural Integrity

- [ ] All six domains are present and approved
- [ ] No draft, scratch, or exploratory files exist
- [ ] Directory structure matches intent freezes
- [ ] Media exists only as referenced infrastructure

---

## 2. Reading Path Validation

- [ ] Recruiter fast path (60–120s) is clear
- [ ] Hiring manager path (5–10 min) is coherent
- [ ] Technical reviewer path supports selective depth
- [ ] No forced deep reading required to understand value

---

## 3. Signal Clarity Review

- [ ] No page over-claims capability
- [ ] No page under-signals judgment
- [ ] No domain contradicts another
- [ ] Tradeoffs and limits are visible and honest

---

## 4. Metadata & Consistency

- [ ] YAML front-matter present on all pages
- [ ] Canonical page types enforced
- [ ] Domains and tags are consistent
- [ ] No metadata drift or improvisation

---

## 5. Media & Asset Sanity Check

- [ ] All media assets are referenced in context
- [ ] No decorative or standalone media exists
- [ ] Media does not carry narrative weight alone
- [ ] Broken or unused assets are removed

---

## 6. Appendix Exposure Control

- [ ] Appendix does not dominate navigation
- [ ] Certifications support, not replace, evidence
- [ ] Skills and tools are presented as reference only

---

## 7. Final Authority Check

- [ ] Ceven has reviewed the full system
- [ ] No unresolved objections remain
- [ ] Release decision is explicit, not assumed

---

## Deployment Authorization

Public deployment may occur **only when Ceven explicitly confirms**:

> “Approve public release of CJK_Knowledgehub”

Absent this confirmation, deployment is prohibited.
