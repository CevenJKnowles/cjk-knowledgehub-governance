# Phase 4 — Implementation & Content Build

### Locked Architectural Direction & Source of Truth

---
# 1. Strategic Direction (Frozen)

## Path Selection
We have chosen:

> **Path B — Systems Architecture Positioning with Embedded Reliability & Governance**

This portfolio is **not** a prompt showcase.  
It is a **systems architecture demonstration** where prompts are components of a larger, reliable AI workflow.

Primary positioning:

- AI Workflow Designer
- AI Product Owner (trajectory)
- AI Engineer (LLM workflow / orchestration focus)
- Senior Prompt Engineer (systems-level)

This is intentional and strategic.

---
# 2. Master Thesis of the Portfolio Artifact

## Title (Working)

> **Reliable Multi-Model AI Documentation & Governance Architecture**

This is demonstrated through a fictional but realistic system.

The goal is to show:

- Structured orchestration
- Multi-model reasoning
- Evaluation discipline
- Governance maturity
- Product-level thinking
- Architectural trade-off awareness

---
---

# 3. Anchor Use Case (Locked)

## Fictional Platform

**FlowCore**  
An internal enterprise workflow automation platform.

Tone:  
- Balanced  
- Enterprise-neutral  
- Technical but not niche  
- Not startup-branded  
- Not compliance-heavy  

FlowCore automates:

- HR approval workflows  
- Procurement routing  
- Compliance approvals  
- Internal ticket escalations  

The AI system being demonstrated is **not the workflow platform itself**, but:

> The AI-powered Documentation & Governance Generator for that platform.

---
---
# 4. System Overview

The AI architecture ingests fragmented internal documentation inputs and produces structured, evaluated, and governance-aware documentation outputs.

It demonstrates:

- Multi-source ingestion
- Model routing logic
- Self-evaluation loops
- Failure taxonomy
- Safety boundary injection
- Version awareness
- Terminology normalization

---
# 5. Architectural Layers (Frozen)

## Layer 1 — Evaluation Engine

Purpose:
- Define quality operationally
- Score outputs objectively
- Enable controlled iteration

Includes:
- Multi-axis rubric (4–6 axes max)
- Format compliance scoring
- Terminology consistency checks
- Coverage validation (input completeness)
- Hallucination flag heuristics
- Model comparison scoring
- Failure taxonomy

This layer is reusable across the system.

## Layer 2 — Orchestrated Multi-Model Workflow

Purpose:
- Decompose intent
- Normalize fragmented sources
- Route tasks across models
- Enforce structured output
- Refine through evaluation feedback

High-level flow:

1. Intent normalization
2. Source parsing & segmentation
3. Model routing decision
4. Draft generation
5. Evaluation scoring
6. Refinement loop
7. Safety/governance injection

This is the core systems demonstration.

## Layer 3 — Safety & Governance Layer

Purpose:
- Handle ambiguity
- Prevent fabricated claims
- Inject disclaimers where needed
- Flag unsupported features
- Escalate uncertainty

Includes:

- Boundary detection
- Policy ambiguity detection
- Permission-based clarifications
- Risk-aware rewrite logic
- Explicit limitation statements

This layer signals production maturity.

# 6. Multi-Model Constellation (Locked)

We will use three LLM environments conceptually:

- **ChatGPT (online)**  
  → Structured formatting precision  
  → Strong instruction adherence  

- **Claude (online)**  
  → Long-context synthesis  
  → Nuanced reasoning  

- **Local LLM (e.g., Llama)**  
  → Cost-controlled draft iteration  
  → Controlled formatting enforcement  
  → Private/offline simulation  

We will demonstrate:

- Tradeoff reasoning
- Routing logic justification
- Comparative evaluation
- Failure differences across models
- Cost vs capability awareness

No overengineering.  
No heavy infrastructure build.  
Demonstration > deployment.

---
# 7. Documentation Outputs (Locked)

The system must generate exactly **five structured outputs**:

1. **Role-Based User Guide**  
   - Administrator view  
   - Manager view  
   - Operator view  

2. **Technical Reference Overview**  
   - Lightweight API summary  
   - Integration notes  
   - Structural explanation  

3. **Structured Release Notes**  
   - Version-aware  
   - Categorized  
   - Clean format  

4. **Governance & Safety Disclaimer Layer**  
   - Permission boundaries  
   - Escalation policies  
   - Risk notes  
   - Unsupported feature flags  

5. **Terminology Glossary**  
   - Normalized definitions  
   - Drift detection  
   - Consistency enforcement  

These five outputs together demonstrate system maturity.

---
# 8. Input Data Strategy (Locked)

## Source Type

We will use a **fictional enterprise-neutral Source Pack**.

We will create the data ourselves.

No external datasets required.

## Format Constraints

- 6–8 source documents
- Each 150–400 words
- Total input target: ~1,500–2,500 words
- Text-first
- One lightweight Roles/Permissions table included

## Source Document Types (Spec)

Examples:

- feature-list.md
- api-notes.md
- roles-permissions.md (with small table)
- faq-draft.md
- release-notes-fragments.md
- known-issues.md
- support-tickets-sample.md
- ui-labels.txt (terminology drift source)

## Intentional Defects (Locked)

We will deliberately plant three defect categories:

1. **Terminology Drift**
   - Multiple inconsistent terms for the same concept.

2. **Version Mismatch**
   - Feature availability conflicts between docs.

3. **Policy Ambiguity**
   - Unclear permissions or approval boundaries.

These are required to activate:

- Evaluation engine
- Refinement loop
- Governance layer
- Safety disclaimers

# 9. Strategic Positioning


This portfolio artifact should make a recruiter think:

> “This person designs reliable, multi-model AI systems with measurable quality and embedded governance.”

Not:

> “This person writes good prompts.”

It is a system architecture demonstration.

---
# 10. Constraints (Strict)

- No overengineering
- No heavy infrastructure build
- No SaaS simulation
- One fictional platform only
- No scope creep into unrelated domains
- Repo structure will be derived from this architecture (not vice versa)

This document becomes the **single source of truth for Phase 4 portfolio content**.

This document becomes the **single source of truth for Phase 4 portfolio content**.
