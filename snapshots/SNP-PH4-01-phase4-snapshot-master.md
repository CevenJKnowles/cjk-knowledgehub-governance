# Phase 4 — Snapshot Master

## 1. Phase Context

Phase 4 focused on:

- Implementation architecture definition
- Evaluation doctrine formalisation
- Repo structure intent freeze
- Portfolio positioning freeze

This document consolidates all Phase 4 checkpoint and post-freeze records.

Supersedes:
- 04g_phase-4-snapshot.md
- 04h_post-phase-4-imp-eva-doctrine-freeze.md

---

## 2. Checkpoint Record (From 04g)

### 1. Session Objective (Original Intent)

Resume **Phase 4 — Implementation & Content Build** under governance contract.

Constraints:
- All prior intent freezes remain authoritative.
- Repo structure must align to Phase 2 freeze.
- Mechanical execution under review gates.
- No content generation until scaffolding is correct.

---

### 2. What Was Done Today

#### A. Infrastructure Stabilization
- Verified correct repo path:
  `/home/cjk/Dev/GitHub/CJK_KnowledgeHub`
- Clean local backup of old KnowledgeHub confirmed.
- Git baseline committed.
- YAML Metadata Schema v0.2 frozen.
- MkDocs environment rebuilt using dedicated venv:
  `/home/cjk/Dev/Environments/knowledgehub-mkdocs`
- `khub()` dev command created (activate + serve + auto-deactivate).

Infrastructure is now stable.

---

#### B. Naming Decision
- A fictional enterprise system was required as demonstration substrate.
- Initial placeholder name: FlowCore (temporary).
- Final locked name: **Vective**.
- All scaffold references renamed to Vective.
- Rename committed and pushed.

Important:
Vective is a fictional demonstration system,
NOT the KnowledgeHub identity.

---

#### C. Strategic Fork (Resolved)

Decision Locked:
Vective will serve as an integrated substrate for:

1. Prompt Evaluation Framework
2. Workflow Orchestration
3. Safety & Governance Design

This is one unified demonstration environment,
not three unrelated projects.

---

#### D. Misalignment Moment

Structural drift occurred when:
- Vective was temporarily elevated to top-level identity.
- Narrative framing shifted from portfolio structure to product architecture.
- Placement logic became unclear (appendix vs top-level vs domain-contained).

Drift has been acknowledged.
No structural changes were finalized beyond renaming.

---

### 3. Current Ground Truth

#### Repository State
- Clean scaffold exists.
- YAML v0.2 active.
- MkDocs operational.
- No content created yet.
- No Source Pack scaffold finalized.
- No final placement for Vective container locked.

#### Conceptual State
We have locked:
- Integrated Vective substrate (Lock A)
We have NOT locked:
- Exact folder placement for Vective.
- Exact folder hierarchy for its internal structure.
- Navigation design strategy.

We paused before executing further structure changes.

---

### 4. Open Decisions (Unresolved)

1. Where does Vective live structurally?
   - Under prompt-engineering?
   - Hybrid system + project layout?
   - Alternative?

2. What is the cleanest structure that:
   - Signals systems thinking
   - Is recruiter-friendly
   - Does not overcomplicate navigation
   - Aligns to Phase 2 freeze

3. How do we prevent structural drift while preserving strength?

---

### 5. Risk Assessment

The risk is not technical.

The risk is:
- Over-architecting
- Narrative drift
- Structure inflation
- Losing alignment with frozen scope

We must return to:
Mechanical, minimal, governance-aligned progression.

---

### 6. What Has NOT Been Done

- No Source Pack files created.
- No Vective directories scaffolded.
- No evaluation layer implemented.
- No orchestration logic implemented.
- No governance documentation written.

We are still at **Gate 1 — Structural Definition**.

This section captures:
- State at checkpoint
- Open constraints
- Decisions under consideration
- Transition triggers

No reinterpretation.

---

## 3. Post-Doctrine Freeze Record (From 04h)

Status: **Frozen (v1.0)**

Locked components:

- Vective canonical placement (Appendix-contained).
- Centralized Source Pack (non-duplicated).
- Evaluation Doctrine v1.0:
  - 5 Core Evaluation Axes.
  - 7 Canonical Evaluation Fixtures.
  - Routing implications defined.
- MkDocs navigation validated.
- YAML v0.2 authoritative.
- No structural drift introduced.
- Repository integrity confirmed.

Phase 4 is complete and must not be modified without explicit revision.

---
### Post-Freeze Work Completed

#### 1. Profile Page — Finalized

- Multiple drafts refined for authenticity.
- Removed corporate/AI-template tone.
- Eliminated excessive rhetorical triads.
- Reduced repetitive “I” statements.
- Preserved deliberate AI transition narrative.
- Balanced recruiter clarity + hiring manager depth + intellectual identity.
- Final version approved and locked.

Key tonal characteristics:
- Calm.
- Constructive.
- Precise.
- Positive framing only.
- No defensive language.
- No inflated claims.
- Organic rhythm.
- Meaningful words only.

---
### Current Position in Master Plan

Phase 1 — Intent Freeze ✔  
Phase 2 — Architecture Freeze ✔  
Phase 3 — Execution Planning ✔  
Phase 4 — Implementation & Evaluation Freeze ✔  
Phase 5 — Prompt Engineering Artifact Construction → **Not yet started**

Portfolio now has:

- Structural integrity.
- Evaluation doctrine.
- Stable contextual substrate.
- Public-facing Profile anchor.

---
### Next Logical Options

1. Refine Career Trajectory page.
2. Refine KnowledgeHub 2026 positioning text.
3. Curate Credentials presentation.
4. Begin Phase 5 artifact planning.
5. Combination of the above in staged sequence.

No technical artifact work has begun yet.

This section captures:
- Final locked architecture components
- Frozen evaluation structure
- Confirmed model constellation
- Resolved structural decisions

---
### 4. Binding Outcomes of Phase 4

The following became authoritative during Phase 4:

- Implementation Architecture Doctrine
- Evaluation Layer Model
- Domain QA Rubric
- Definition of Done
- Vective Intent Freeze
- Repo A directory freeze

These artifacts now live in:

- Governance layer (intent freezes)
- Control layer (architecture + QA + DOD)
- Planning layer (execution triggers)

---
### 5. Phase 4 Exit Condition

Phase 4 concluded when:

- Architecture doctrine was locked.
- Evaluation structure frozen.
- Repo structure intent frozen.
- Snapshot recorded.

Phase 5 may proceed only under these constraints.

---

End of Phase 4 Snapshot Master.
